# CareFreeComposer
## Overview
CareFreeComposer is a machine learning experiment designed to generate music in a style similar to that of which it is trained with. This system will be trained with a multitude of piano concertos. The system is powered by TensorFlow in Python. The goal behind this system was to get a better understanding of TensorFlow and how it can be used to simplify the setup and training of a neural network.
